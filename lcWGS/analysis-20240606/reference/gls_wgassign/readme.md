Genotype likelihood, allele frequencies,  and associated sites files for reference fish. 

The Genotype likelihood beagle.gz files are too big for GitHub, so please get theme at the following links:   
  - [pcod-refs_wholegenome_wgassign.beagle.gz]() - all polymorphic sites identified in reference fish  
  - [pcod-refs_wholegenome_wgassign_unlinked.beagle.gz]() - Unlinked sites - this was used in WGSassign
