### Genetic analysis of experimental fish 

This subdirectory contains files from Laura Spencer's analysis of lcWGS data from all experimental fish. In it, **experimental fish are assigned to known spawning populations** based on lcWGS data from reference fish. The approach uses programs and code from a combination of the [AFSC lcWGS pipeline](https://github.com/AFSC-Genetics/lcWGS-pipeline) and the [amre-adaptation / WGSassign](https://github.com/mgdesaix/amre-adaptation/tree/main) pipeline. 

  - All steps are laid out in the notebook [01-lcWGS-WGSassign.Rmd](../notebooks/01-lcWGS-WGSassign.Rmd).
  - Raw lcWGS data from experimental fish is stored on the NWFS Sedna and AFSC SednaGold servers, and will be up on NCBI soon(!)
  - Raw lcWGS data from reference fish was derived from a study by Ingrid Spies and Sara Schaal (paper _in prep_), which is also stored on AFSC's servers
