# 2 Database Creation

## 2.1 Obtain Fasta (UniProt/Swiss-Prot)

This is from here picur reviewe sequences I named based on the identify
of the database given

``` bash
cd ../data
curl -O https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz
mv uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz uniprot_sprot_r2023_04.fasta.gz
gunzip -k uniprot_sprot_r2023_04.fasta.gz
```

## 2.2 Making the database

``` bash
mkdir ../blastdb
/home/shared/ncbi-blast-2.11.0+/bin/makeblastdb \
-in ../data/uniprot_sprot_r2023_04.fasta \
-dbtype prot \
-out ../blastdb/uniprot_sprot_r2023_04
```

# 3 Running Blastx

``` bash
/home/shared/ncbi-blast-2.11.0+/bin/blastx \
-query ../data/Gadus_macrocephalus.coding.gene.V1.cds \
-db ../blastdb/uniprot_sprot_r2023_04 \
-out ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx.tab \
-evalue 1E-20 \
-num_threads 20 \
-max_target_seqs 1 \
-outfmt 6
```

``` bash
head -2 ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx.tab
```

    ## Gma_1G0000010.1  sp|P22735|TGM1_HUMAN    50.659  683 318 7   328 2334    109 786 0.0 688
    ## Gma_1G0000020.1  sp|Q9JI35|HRH3_CAVPO    54.684  395 160 4   136 1266    50  443 1.98e-140   411

``` bash
echo "Number of lines in output"
wc -l ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx.tab
```

    ## Number of lines in output
    ## 11575 ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx.tab

# 4 Joining Blast table with annoations.

## 4.1 Prepping Blast table for easy join

``` bash
tr '|' '\t' < ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx.tab \
> ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx_sep.tab

head -1 ../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx_sep.tab
```

    ## Gma_1G0000010.1  sp  P22735  TGM1_HUMAN  50.659  683 318 7   328 2334    109 786 0.0 688

## 4.2 Could do some cool stuff in R here reading in table

``` r
bltabl <- read.csv("../output/03-transcriptome-annotation/Gm.cds-uniprot_blastx_sep.tab", sep = '\t', header = FALSE)

spgo <- read.csv("https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/seashell/snaps/uniprot_table_r2023_01.tab", sep = '\t', header = TRUE)
```

``` r
datatable(head(bltabl), options = list(scrollX = TRUE, scrollY = "400px", scrollCollapse = TRUE, paging = FALSE))
